	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<h2>Welcome to Petru Dimitriu's page!</h2>
	<p> <b>Who I am.</b> My name is <b>Petru Dimitriu</b> (Peter, if you wish). Just a human being trying his best to do good and share love.</p>
	<p><b>What I do.</b> I code for faculty and personal IT projects, always seeking to forge stuff that is actually useful. But I do a lot more other things, so I seldom think of myself as a programmer, though I often genuinely act as one. Programming is merely the means by which I seek to attain my goals and manifest my creativity and imagination.</p>
	<p> <b>I like</b> (among many other things) reading and singing. <b>I strongly dislike </b> computer games, which I find to be time, money and life wasters and I am very unknowledgeable when it comes to them. (Yes, I have friends and acquaintances still perplexed at that, with some trying to make me change my mind.)</p>
	<p> Currently I am interested in exploring music and signal processing.</p>
